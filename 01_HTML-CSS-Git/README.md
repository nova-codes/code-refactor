# OO1: Code Refactor 

The basis of this assignment was to take pre-existing code that was provided to all students and refactor it. Refactoring code includes - but is not limited to - updating pre-existing code to make it accessible for people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions. 

It is also used to make the pre-existing code neat, efficient, easy to navigate, and sustainable for any future updates. This part of the process can include tasks such as consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing the CSS to follow the flow of the HTML mark-up, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

As I refactored the given code, I added small, additional comments within the HTML and CSS to indicate what changed and *why* those parts changed, if applicable.
